=====================
Portal Documentation
=====================

This module extends Document Page to allow serving documentation through the
website portal.

Installation
============

This module depends on module document_page. So make sure to have it in your addons list.

Configuration
=============

No configuration required.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Go to Knowledge menu
* Click on Categories to create the document's category you need with the template
* Click on Pages to create pages and select the previous category to use the template
* Configure user permissions (User, Editor, Manager)

Then: 

* As a permissioned user, go to the portal. The categories and documents will
display seamlessly with other portal content.


Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Make granular access permissions so document access is controlled by a
combination of groups / users specified at the document.page level.
